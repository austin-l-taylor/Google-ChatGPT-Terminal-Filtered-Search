Finally!
To fully omptimize this project you will need to setup an alias with a .bat script that points to the file location using Doskey.
You can make a DOSKEY macro permanent by creating a macro definition file and adding it to the Autorun registry key for the Command Processor. 
Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
Create a macro definition file: Open a text editor and type your DOSKEY macros in the following format: macroname=command. For example, if you want to create a DOSKEY macro for the ipconfig command called ip, you would type doskey ip=ipconfig. Save this file with any name you like (e.g., macros.txt) in a location of your choice.

Add the macro definition file to the Autorun registry key: Open the Registry Editor by pressing the Windows key + R, typing regedit, and pressing Enter. Navigate to the following key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor. Right-click on the right pane and select New > String Value. Name the new value Autorun. Double-click on the new value and set its data to doskey /macrofile="<path to your macro definition file>", replacing <path to your macro definition file> with the actual path to your macro definition file.

After completing these steps, your DOSKEY macros will be automatically loaded every time you open a new Command Prompt window1.
